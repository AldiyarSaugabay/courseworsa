                The Boston Celtics have confirmed that their All-Star point guard will be sidelined for approximately two to three weeks after suffering a high ankle sprain during Monday night’s matchup against the Brooklyn Nets. The injury occurred early in the third quarter when he landed awkwardly on a defender’s foot while driving to the basket.
            </p>

            <h2>The Moment of Injury</h2>
            <p>
                The play appeared harmless at first, but the guard immediately grabbed his right ankle and limped off the court in visible pain. He did not return to the game, and postgame evaluations revealed the sprain. According to team sources, MRI results confirmed no structural damage  a positive sign amid the setback.
            </p>

            <div class="quote">
                “He’s in good spirits, but we’re going to be cautious. The focus is getting him back healthy for the long stretch of the season.”
                <div class="quotauthor"> Joe Mazzulla, Celtics Head Coach</div>
            </div>

            <h2>Impact on the Celtics’ Rotation</h2>
            <p>
                The injury leaves Boston temporarily without its primary ball-handler and floor general. The coaching staff is expected to rely on Derrick White and Payton Pritchard to share playmaking duties during his absence. Veteran guard Jrue Holiday could also see increased minutes at the point.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Celtics have built one of the league’s most balanced rosters, but losing their All-Star leader affects both ends of the floor. His elite decision-making, perimeter defense, and transition control have been central to Boston’s 9–2 start to the season.

            <h2>Medical Outlook</h2>
            <p>
                Team doctors classified the injury as a Grade 2 sprain, typically requiring two to three weeks of rehabilitation. The player will undergo treatment, including physical therapy and strengthening exercises, before resuming on-court activity. The Celtics medical staff will reassess his condition prior to their upcoming West Coast road trip.
            </p>

            <p>
                The timeline suggests he could return before the start of December, depending on progress and pain tolerance. The team emphasized that there will be no rush to bring him back prematurely.

            <div class="quote">
                “It could’ve been worse. The MRI looked clean. We’ll manage his workload carefully and make sure he’s fully ready before returning.”

            <h2>Upcoming Schedule</h2>
            <p>
                The Celtics face a challenging stretch without their star guard, including games against the Milwaukee Bucks, Miami Heat, and Philadelphia 76ers  all top-tier Eastern Conference opponents. Boston’s depth will be tested as they look to maintain their early-season momentum.

            <h2>Team Response</h2>
            <p>
                Teammates expressed confidence that the Celtics can weather the stretch without their All-Star guard. Derrick White noted that the group’s defensive identity will remain their foundation, while Jayson Tatum emphasized the need for ball movement and collective effort.
            </p>

            <div class="quote">
                “We’ll hold it down for him. Everyone has to step up  it’s next man up mentality.”
                <div class="quotauthor"> Jayson Tatum</div>
            </div>

            <h2>The Verdict</h2>
            <p>
                While the injury is a setback, the Celtics appear well-positioned to manage the short absence. Their deep roster, strong defense, and veteran leadership provide stability. If recovery goes as planned, their star guard should be back in action within three weeks  just in time for the team’s critical December stretch.
            </p>

            <p>
                For now, Boston’s resilience will be tested  but their championship aspirations remain intact.

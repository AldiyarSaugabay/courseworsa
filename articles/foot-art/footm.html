                <p>
                    The Premier League title race is reaching fever pitch as Manchester City and Arsenal go head-to-head in the final weeks of the season. The dynamics shifted dramatically over the past weekend, setting up a dramatic finale that could once again go down to the wire.
                </p>

                <h2>The New Look Table: Four Points Separate the Top Two</h2>
                <p>
                    While the headline correctly notes the heat, the "unbeaten in their last eight games" is only partially true after Matchweek 11. Arsenal’s unbeaten streak in wins was punctured by a late equalizer against Sunderland (2-2), and while City's form is fearsome, they have suffered three league losses this season compared to Arsenal's one. However, City’s emphatic 3-0 victory over reigning champions Liverpool has closed the gap to just four points, revitalizing the contest.
                </p>

                <div class="quote">
                    "Arsenal had a runaway looking likely, but City’s dismantling of Liverpool was a statement. You cannot ignore that feeling of 'here we go again'City are building toward something frightening under Guardiola."

                </div>

                <h2>Arsenal’s Case: Defensive Steel and Early Momentum</h2>
                <p>
                    Mikel Arteta's side currently sits top with 26 points from 11 games. Their position is built on a historically stingy defense, having conceded only 5 goals all seasona league bestand boasting a goal difference of +15. Prior to the 2-2 draw with Sunderland, Arsenal had kept a remarkable run of clean sheets.
                </p>

                <h3>Arsenal's Key Statistics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Games Played: 11 (8 Wins, 2 Draws, 1 Loss)</li>
                    <li>Goals Conceded: 5 (Best in the League)</li>
                    <li>Goals For: 20</li>
                    <li>Points Lead Over City: 4</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The team's success has been characterized by control and tactical discipline, but the late error by David Raya against Sunderland showed a fragile side to their mental armor that Manchester City will look to exploit.
                </p>

                <h2>The City Threat: Form, Depth, and History</h2>
                <p>
                    Manchester City, on 22 points, is in full 'chase mode.' Their recent 3-0 victory over Liverpool was a tactical masterclass, highlighted by the "world-class" performance of Jeremy Doku, who was instrumental in the attack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    City's primary title argument is their Goal Difference of +15(equal to Arsenal's) and their ability to string together seemingly unstoppable winning runs. Erling Haaland, despite missing a penalty against Liverpool, remains the league's top scorer with 14 goals. With Pep Guardiola celebrating his 1,000th game as a manager, the psychological factor of a relentless, experienced champion chasing a relatively inexperienced leader is huge.
                </p>

                    <h3>Man City's Offensive Power</h3>
                    <div class="scoline">
                        <span class="pname">Total Goals Scored</span>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Head-to-Head: The Decisive Battles</h2>
                <p>
                    The season's first league encounter between the two rivals ended in a 1-1 draw at the Emirates Stadium on September 21st, where a late Gabriel Martinelli equaliser salvaged a point for Arsenal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most crucial match will be the return fixture at the Etihad Stadium. Given the tight marginsArsenal finished two points behind City in 2023 and three points behind in 2024that single game could very well decide the destination of the Premier League trophy. Analysts currently give Arsenal a 65.49 chance of winning the title, compared to City's 19.43, but a win for City in that head-to-head would dramatically swing those percentages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With 27 games still left to play, the title race is indeed far from over. Arsenal may be in the driver's seat, but the champions have just sent a thunderous warning that they are back to their relentless best.

                    With only three races remaining in the 2025 Formula 1 season, the title race tightened and then broke open once again at the São Paulo Grand Prix. McLaren's Lando Norris secured a dominant victory, extending his lead over teammate Oscar Piastri, while Red Bull’s Max Verstappen delivered a spectacular charge to keep a slim mathematical hope alive. The battle is now a two-driver shootout, with the advantage firmly in the British driver's hands.

                <h2>Norris Dominates Brazil, Piastri Stumbles</h2>
                <p>
                    Lando Norris delivered a textbook weekend at Interlagos, taking the maximum points available with victories in both the Sprint race and Sunday’s Grand Prix. The performance was a decisive response to mid-season questions about his ability to close out a championship fight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, his title rival and teammate, Oscar Piastri, endured a challenging Sunday. The Australian was handed a 10-second penalty for causing a collision with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli, which ultimately forced Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc to retire. Piastri could only recover to P5, losing critical ground to Norris.

                    "I don't think I've ever felt this comfortable leading a championship. We’ve turned a corner mentally; it’s about ignoring the noise and just focusing on maximum points. This one was for Gil [de Ferran], one of my mentors."

                <h2>Verstappen’s Astonishing Comeback</h2>
                <p>
                    The drive of the day belonged to Max Verstappen. After a poor qualifying session forced Red Bull to change his power unit and setupresulting in a pit-lane startthe four-time champion carved through the field with breathtaking precision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite suffering a puncture early on, which required an extra stop, Verstappen finished an astonishing P3, battling Mercedes’ rookie Kimi Antonelli right up to the finish line. While this result keeps the Drivers' Championship mathematically open for Verstappen, the 49-point deficit to Norris with 83 points remaining makes the title highly unlikely. The focus now shifts to Red Bull defending P3 in the Constructors' standings.

                <h2>The Title Decider: McLaren Internal Battle</h2>
                <p>
                    With the Constructors’ Championship already clinched by McLaren, the final three racesLas Vegas, Qatar, and Abu Dhabiwill be a tense internal battle for the Drivers’ Crown. Norris’s 24-point cushion means he controls his own destiny; two more solid podium finishes will likely seal the title.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Piastri, needing to win all three remaining races and hope Norris suffers major setbacks, admitted the weekend was "tough," but vowed to reset for the final triple-header. The pressure is now squarely on the Australian to turn around a streak of poor luck and mistakes that have eroded his mid-season lead.

                    "The ship has sailed for Max Verstappen's title hopes. It is now a straight fight between Lando and Oscar. Lando has the momentum, the lead, and crucially, the confidence after this phenomenal win."
